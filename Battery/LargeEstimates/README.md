# Large battery estimates

This directory hosts images of unusually large battery life estimate screenshots. For it to become unusually large, it has to be between 16-20+ hours of an estimate for 100% battery, and similar rules for lower amounts.

Ubuntu seems to have a common problem with these estimates when it doesn't finish estimating when you unplug. I am not the only person with this issue. In the past, I have seen Ubuntu users get 100+ hour estimates with less than 15% battery, so I know this is a common issue due to how frequently it happens to me.

The largest estimate I have gotten as of April 24th 2021 is `231 hours and 42 minutes` (`231:42`) at 100% battery to 0% this is of course highly untrue, as my laptop normally only lasts ~3.5-10.2 hours on battery while in heavy use or while idle/in low usage.
