# Incident report March 29th 2021

There were multiple battery issues today. As of March 30th 2021 at 6:15 pm, they don't seem to have come back.

## Not documented

Before I got screenshots, I noted that my laptop dropped from 22% to 19% in 1 big drop (a 3% drop) and I went and plugged it in. Since then, it had more issues.

## 92 percent issue

The battery got stuck charging at 92% and took about 1 hour and 15 minutes to go from 92% to 100%. I really believe this is a false reading, as when I unplugged at 100%, it immediately dropped to 92%, and the battery life acted like that 8% was still there, which gave me much more battery life than normal (if I actually had 92%)

## Resolution

Just a bad reading bug, occurs monthly/at random. The system is not actually affected by this as far as I know.
