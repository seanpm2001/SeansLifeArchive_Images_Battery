# Normal estimates

This directory is for images of my everyday battery percentage normal. As of 2021, the normal estimate is between 20 minutes and 24 hours.

## What is with all the As

I started a little joke here as a pun of `A` `AA` (Double A)` and `AAA` (Triple A) batteries, then just kept going. I found that by default, GitHub only supports 37 characters per directory name before cutting it off.

Here is the tree as of 2021 October 19th

I am hoping Internet communities such as Reddits [r/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA](https://www.reddit.com/r/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/) find interest in this, even if it is just for 1 post.

I was considering doing the same thing with the letter B, so that the text art would look like the flag of Nepal (ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡µ) but currently, I decided not to. I still have 38 months of data to fill out, so I might reconsider in this time. I might just do a different form of the letter A, as the Internet rule on using the letter A like this is to not use the "inferior" letter B.
