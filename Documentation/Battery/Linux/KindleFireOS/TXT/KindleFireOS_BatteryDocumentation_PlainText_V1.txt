Other important battery advice
For Lithium Ion batteries
    1) Lithium batteries degrade over time. Do not buy a replacement battery while your current battery is in perfect health, as the backup battery will degrade/rot in storage, then by the time you need to use it, it will not work very well/at all.
    2) Based on general advice, it is recommended to not let your battery drop below 20% and not charge above 80% this is best for the batteries health. If you can’t follow the step of stopping every charge at 80%, you can at least plug your device in when it gets low (for example: lately, always plug mine in at 23-29% battery)
    3) MacOS 11.0 (Big Sur) and subsequent versions (MacOS 12.0 Monterey) have a built-in feature to limit battery discharge at 20% and battery charge at 80%. I don’t know of any other operating system that forces this rule (Ubuntu says it does, but it actually doesn’t, as I have used my device with less than 11% battery before)
General battery advice
       DO NOT use your phone while it is plugged into a cable charger. Take it from me. I have destroyed the charging port on 6 different devices by using it while plugged in in less than 6 months per device. Also, be careful using a cable charger as well. I prefer wireless charging when available, and nowadays, it is mandatory for my cellular devices, as my Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G got a destroyed charging port in less than 4 months.
       DO NOT hard power cycle your device UNLESS completely necessary (completely unresponsive, softlocked) (hard power cycle means holding the power button down for 10 seconds, or removing the battery while the device is running) as this damages the software running and can cause corruption.
