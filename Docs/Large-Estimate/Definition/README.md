# Large Estimate

## Definition

### What is a large estimate?

A large estimate is a severely overcalculated battery life estimate. Previously, before 2022 June 14th, I had no set definition for this. With the use of my new laptop, I am making the definition:

| Order | Device model and manufacturer | Operating system | Device wattage (in Watt Hours) | Large estimate definition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | Samsung laptop (unknown model) | Windows 8 | ? Wh | Large estimate is 16 hours or higher |
| 02 | Dell laptop (unknown model) | Windows 10 | ? Wh | Large estimate is 20 hours or higher |
| 03 | Dell XPS 13 | Ubuntu 20.04 | 51 Wh | Large estimate is 20 hours or higher |
| 04 | System76 Pangolin | Ubuntu 22.04 | 49.4 Wh | Large estimate is 24 hours or higher |

Why is the System76 device have higher standards despite having less capacity? It comes with several battery saving features I previously didn't have under Ubuntu 20.04.
